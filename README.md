# Nuxeo Swagger Utilities

This repository contains scripts to convert the Nuxeo Swagger 1.2 collection to a single file and render it with Swagger 2.0. 

To generate the files, run a local server (or update the `get.sh` script):

```
% ./get.sh
```

# Installation

Load the Swagger files from the `output` directory into the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or your favorite REST tool.  Use the 'Import' command in [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to load the 'v2.0' collections.
